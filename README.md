# auto-repair-crm

Build a PHP CRM web application for an automotive repair shop. It should include invoice generation, service estimates, task management, team communication, employee hours tracking, and ,repairs and parts pricing lookup. The interface must be user-friendly, inspired by ShopMonkey.com, with automation capabilities for routine tasks. Use Laravel or Symfony for the backend, Vue.js or React for the frontend, and MySQL or PostgreSQL for the database. Integrate external APIs for real-time parts pricing.
